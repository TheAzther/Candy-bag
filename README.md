# Candy-bag
A code practice of an inventory using a bag of candy bars and 5 users as a simple example. 

This script will create two JSON files named usuarios.json and datos.json if they aren't precent in the directory, usuarios contains a object containing all 5 users and their sub-objects. datos is the object that contains the candy bars object and their maximum value (this would be the candy bar in real life).

There are 3 options: See the current state of an user (see how many and wich candy bars they've eaten), see how many bars are left and add a n amount of eaten bars to a user wich in return will reduce said amount to the original bag.

This code is in spanish BTW.
